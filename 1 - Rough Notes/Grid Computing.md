# Grid Computing

A computer grid is a form of distributed computing where this kinda of computing provides a platform in which computing resources are organized into on or more logical pools. 
These pools are different in term of hardware and are **geo-localized**.
These pools form like a "virtual super computer" that provides high performance.
So it's heavy based on a middleware layers that can contain load balancing logic, failover controls and autonomic configuration management
