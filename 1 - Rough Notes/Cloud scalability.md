# Cloud scalability

The cloud Scalability is the ability of cloud based system to adapts to requests of clients.
This ability is heavy oriented to the configuration and it indicates that the system can scale in:
- [[Horizontal Cloud Scalability|Horizontal Way]].
- [[Vertical Cloud Scalability|Vertical Way]].

But this scale does not happen in real time in opposition to the [[Cloud Elasticity]].
So It's simply the ability to allocate easily virtual machine and change hardware configuration of nodes without additional works.
## Comparison between Horizontal and Vertical Scalability
