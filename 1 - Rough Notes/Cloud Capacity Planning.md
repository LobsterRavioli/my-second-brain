# Cloud Capacity Planning

The **Capacity Planning** is the process of determining and predicting the future demands of an IT organization in terms on IT resources, products and service.
The capacity is the maximum amount of work that the IT resource can provides in a given period of time.

If this capacity is overestimated we're talking about over-provisioning.
- Allocates more IT resource we actually need in correspondence of client requests, highly inefficient waste of money for that resources.

If this capacity is underestimated  we're talking about under-provisioning.
- Allocate less IT resource we actually need in correspondence of the client requests and that's bad couse we're loosing potential clients.

There's some capacity planning strategies:
- **Lead Strategy**: Adding capacity planning in anticipation of demand.
- **Lag Strategy**: Adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity.
- **Match Strategy**: Adding IT resource in small increments, as demands increase.
