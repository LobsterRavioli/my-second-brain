# Linux Distributions

There are many [[Linux]] distributions but the main ones are:
- [[Debian]]
- Slackware
- [[Redhat]]
- Arch-Linux
- Android

The main differences between all these distribution are:
- The system architecture is completly different
- The management of the packages (the format of the packages and the package manager)

## Which one you should use?

- **Ubuntu**: easy to setup
- **Mint**: More Windows-like
- **Fedora**: Is a distro from RedHat, there's no need to manage system **configuration**. It's good for professional environment.
- **Arch linux**: For hacker guys and there's a lot of software out there.
