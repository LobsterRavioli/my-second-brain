The logical volume manager is like an abstraction for a physical volume.
In this Manager there is 3 main actors:
- Physical Volume
- Volume Group
- Logical Volume

The main advantage for the LVM is the flexibility be
LVM are good for dynamic secondary memory allocation, you could allocate another physical volume for expanding volume group and then allocate more volume to the logical volumes.
