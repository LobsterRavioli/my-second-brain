# 101.2 Explorational Exercises

# Explorational Exercises

1. The bootloader will present a list of operating systems to choose from when more than one operating system is installed on the machine. However, a newly installed operating system can overwrite the MBR of the hard disk, erasing the first stage of the bootloader and making the other operating system inaccessible. Why would this not happen on a machine equipped with a UEFI firmware?

2. What is a common consequence of installing a custom kernel without providing an appropriate initramfs image?

3. The initialization log is hundreds of lines long, so the output of dmesg command is often piped to a pager command — like command less — to facilitate the reading. What dmesg option will automatically paginate its output, eliminating the need to use a pager command explicitly?

4. A hard drive containing the entire filesystem of an offline machine was removed and attached to a working machine as a secondary drive. Assuming its mount point is `/mnt/hd`, how would journalctl be used to inspect the contents of the journal files located at `/mnt/hd/var/log/journal/`?
