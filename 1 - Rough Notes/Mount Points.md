# Mount Points

A mount point its the specific path where a file system is attached.
You define a mount point and then you attached the filesystem to it.

Like if we connect to an usb to a linux system the default mount point will be in `/media`
For example, a USB flash drive with the label `FlashDrive` connected by the user `john` would be mounted under `/media/john/FlashDrive/`.
