# Understanding cloud computing

## Origins and Influences
### What exactly is Cloud Computing

There's some definition of cloud computing.

#### Cloud Computing Gartner Definition

> [!PDF|255, 208, 0] [[01_understanding_cloud_computing.pdf#page=3&annotation=441R|01_understanding_cloud_computing, p.3]]
> > “…a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to external customers using Internet technologies.”

This definition is heavy emphasize the ability of [[Cloud scalability|scalability]] and the [[Cloud Elasticity|elasticity]].

#### Cloud Computing forester Definition

> [!PDF|255, 208, 0] [[01_understanding_cloud_computing.pdf#page=3&annotation=449R|01_understanding_cloud_computing, p.3]]
> > “…a standardized IT capability (services,  software,  or infrastructure) delivered via Internet technologies in a [[Cloud Computing pay-per-use|pay-per-use]], [[Cloud Computing Self Service|self-service way]].”
> 
> 


#### Cloud Computing NIST Definition

> [!PDF|255, 208, 0] [[01_understanding_cloud_computing.pdf#page=4&annotation=452R|01_understanding_cloud_computing, p.4]]
> > “Cloud computing is a model for enabling [[Cloud Computing Ubiquitos Access| ubiquitous]],  convenient,  on-demand network access to a shared pool of conﬁgurable computing resources (e.g.,  networks,  servers,  storage,  applications,  and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of ﬁve essential characteristics,  three service models,  and four deployment models.”

#### Cloud Computing Book definition

> [!PDF|255, 208, 0] [[01_understanding_cloud_computing.pdf#page=4&annotation=460R|01_understanding_cloud_computing, p.4]]
> > “Cloud computing is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for remotely provisioning scalable and measured resources.”
> 
>

### Business Drivers

The cloud is born from business motivation.
These business concerns shaped the characteristics, models and mechanisms of the cloud from both ends (client and vendor prospective).

The key aspects for using the cloud from a business perspective:

- [[Cloud Capacity Planning|Capacity Planning]]
- [[Cloud Coast Reduction]]
- [[Cloud Organizational Agility]]

### Cloud  Computing inspired Technologies

Cloud computing is inspired from these kinda technologies:
- [[Clustering]]: clustering is fault-toulerant and has a lot of redundancy for his euqal nodes this core to cloud platform.
- [[Grid Computing]]: The middleware of grid computing inspired cloud computing, principle like configuration management, failover management and load balance logic are trasposed to the cloud.
- [[Virtualization]]: Virtualization is key concept in Cloud Computing, Cloud can offer various level of virtualization.


## Basic concepts and terminology

| Terminology                |
| -------------------------- |
| [[IT Resources]]           |
| [[On-Premise]]             |
| [[Cloud Consumer]]         |
| [[Cloud Provider]]         |
| [[Cloud scalability]]      |
| [[Cloud Service]]          |
| [[Cloud Service Consumer]] |

## Goals and Benefits

Why you should use cloud computing?

The main advantages on use clouds are:
- Hardware coasts at beginning are more affordable.
- The adoption of cloud is scalable the coasts grow with the requests of the client.
- Unlimited resources
- Add or remove IT resources at a fine-grained level.



### Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs
Other main advantages of implementing cloud in a Business is for the intrinsic abilities of cloud.
The scalability of cloud permits the business to respond to unpredictable load spikes of clients, therefore the availability of cloud permits the business to increase the quality of service and avoid potential loss of business for runtime failures.
